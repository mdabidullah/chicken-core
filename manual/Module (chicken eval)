== Module (chicken eval)

This module provides a handful of hooks that allow more fine-grained
control over how the standard procedure {{eval}} behaves.

=== Custom eval handlers

==== eval-handler

<parameter>(eval-handler)</parameter>

A procedure of one or two arguments. When {{eval}} is invoked, it
calls the value of this parameter with the same arguments. The default
behavior is to evaluate the argument expression and to ignore the
second parameter.


=== Using modules as evaluation environments

==== module-environment

<procedure>(module-environment MODULENAME)</procedure>

Locates the module with the name {{MODULENAME}} and returns an
environment that can be passed as the second argument to {{eval}}. The
evaluated expressions have only access to the bindings that are
visible inside the module. Note that the environment is not mutable.

If the module is not registered in the current process,
{{module-environment}} will try to locate meta-information about the
module by loading any existing import library with the name
{{MODULENAME.import.[scm|so]}}, if possible.

In compiled modules, only exported bindings will be visible to
interactively entered code. In interpreted modules all bindings are
visible.
