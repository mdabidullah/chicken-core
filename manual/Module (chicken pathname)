== Module (chicken pathname)

This module provides procedures for manipulating paths.  If you want
to operate on the files and directories which the paths represent, see
[[Module (chicken file)]].

=== absolute-pathname?

<procedure>(absolute-pathname? PATHNAME)</procedure>

Returns {{#t}} if the string {{PATHNAME}} names an absolute
pathname, and returns {{#f}} otherwise.

=== decompose-pathname

<procedure>(decompose-pathname PATHNAME)</procedure>

Returns three values: the directory-, filename- and extension-components
of the file named by the string {{PATHNAME}}.
For any component that is not contained in {{PATHNAME}}, {{#f}} is returned.

=== make-pathname
=== make-absolute-pathname

<procedure>(make-pathname DIRECTORY FILENAME [EXTENSION])</procedure><br>
<procedure>(make-absolute-pathname DIRECTORY FILENAME [EXTENSION])</procedure>

Returns a string that names the file with the
components {{DIRECTORY, FILENAME}} and (optionally)
{{EXTENSION}} with {{SEPARATOR}} being the directory separation indicator
(usually {{/}} on UNIX systems and {{\}} on Windows, defaulting to whatever
platform this is running on). 
{{DIRECTORY}} can be {{#f}} (meaning no
directory component), a string or a list of strings. {{FILENAME}}
and {{EXTENSION}} should be strings or {{#f}}.
{{make-absolute-pathname}} returns always an absolute pathname.

=== pathname-directory
=== pathname-file
=== pathname-extension

<procedure>(pathname-directory PATHNAME)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(pathname-file PATHNAME)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(pathname-extension PATHNAME)</procedure>

Accessors for the components of {{PATHNAME}}. If the pathname does
not contain the accessed component, then {{#f}} is returned.

=== pathname-replace-directory
=== pathname-replace-file
=== pathname-replace-extension

<procedure>(pathname-replace-directory PATHNAME DIRECTORY)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(pathname-replace-file PATHNAME FILENAME)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(pathname-replace-extension PATHNAME EXTENSION)</procedure>

Return a new pathname with the specified component of {{PATHNAME}}
replaced by a new value.

=== pathname-strip-directory
=== pathname-strip-extension

<procedure>(pathname-strip-directory PATHNAME)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(pathname-strip-extension PATHNAME)</procedure>

Return a new pathname with the specified component of {{PATHNAME}}
stripped.

=== normalize-pathname

<procedure>(normalize-pathname PATHNAME [PLATFORM])</procedure>

Performs a simple "normalization" on the {{PATHNAME}}, suitably for
{{PLATFORM}}, which should be one of the symbols {{windows}}
or {{unix}} and defaults to on whatever platform is currently
in use. All relative path elements and duplicate separators are processed 
and removed.  If {{NAME}} ends with
a {{/}} or is empty, the appropriate slash is appended to the tail.

No directories or files are actually tested for existence; this 
procedure only canonicalises path syntax.

=== directory-null?

<procedure>(directory-null? DIRECTORY)</procedure>

Does the {{DIRECTORY}} consist only of path separators and the period?

{{DIRECTORY}} may be a string or a list of strings.

=== decompose-directory

<procedure>(decompose-directory DIRECTORY)</procedure>

Returns 3 values: the {{base-origin}}, {{base-directory}}, and the
{{directory-elements}} for the {{DIRECTORY}}.

; {{base-origin}} : a {{string}} or {{#f}}. The drive, if any.
; {{base-directory}} : a {{string}} or {{#f}}. A directory-separator when {{DIRECTORY}} is an {{absolute-pathname}}.
; {{directory-elements}} : a {{list-of string}} or {{#f}}. The non-directory-separator bits.

{{DIRECTORY}} is a {{string}}.

* On Windows {{(decompose-directory "c:foo/bar")}} => {{"c:" #f ("foo" "bar")}}

=== Windows specific notes

Use of UTF8 encoded strings for pathnames is not supported. Windows
uses a 16-bit UNICODE encoding with special system calls for
wide-character support.  Only single-byte string encoding can be used.
