== Module (chicken fixnum)

Because CHICKEN supports a full numeric tower, operations can
sometimes incur a substantial overhead to simply detect the type of numbers
you're passing in.  When you know you're definitely dealing only with
fixnums, you can choose to use fixnum-specific operations to avoid
this overhead.

This is purely a performance hack.  You might want to consider adding
[[Types|type annotations]] instead, this often gives the same
performance boost without having to rewrite all numeric operators in
your code.


=== Arithmetic fixnum operations

<procedure>(fx+ N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx- N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx* N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx/ N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxmod N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxrem N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxneg N)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxmin N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxmax N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxand N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxior N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxxor N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxnot N)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxshl N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxshr N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxgcd N1 N2)</procedure>

{{fx+}} and friends are arithmetic fixnum operations.  These procedures do not
check their arguments, so non-fixnum parameters will result in incorrect
results. {{fxneg}} negates its argument.

On division by zero, {{fx/}}, {{fxmod}} and {{fxrem}} signal a
condition of kind {{(exn arithmetic)}}.

{{fxshl}} and {{fxshr}} perform arithmetic shift left and right,
respectively.

=== Overflow-aware fixnum operations

<procedure>(fx+? N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx-? N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx*? N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx/? N1 N2)</procedure>

These procedures behave similarly to their standard counterparts with
the exception that {{#f}} is returned if an argument is not a fixnum
or the result of the operation overflows.

Chaining of such procedures is well-defined and causes the overflow
error to be propagated.

=== Fixnum comparison and predicates

<procedure>(fxodd? N)</procedure>
<procedure>(fxeven? N)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx= N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx> N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx< N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx>= N1 N2)</procedure>
<procedure>(fx<= N1 N2)</procedure>

Comparison of fixnums and predicates on them.

=== Fixnum limits

<constant>most-positive-fixnum</constant><br>
<constant>most-negative-fixnum</constant><br>
<constant>fixnum-bits</constant><br>
<constant>fixnum-precision</constant><br>

Platform-specific fixnum limits.
