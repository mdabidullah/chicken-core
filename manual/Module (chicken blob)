== Module (chicken blob)

This module contains procedures for dealing with "blobs".  Blobs are
unstructured byte arrays (basically "binary strings"). You can't do
much with them, but they allow conversion to and from
[[Module srfi-4|SRFI-4 number vectors]] which define how to access a
blob's byte contents.

=== make-blob

<procedure>(make-blob SIZE)</procedure>

Returns a blob object of {{SIZE}} bytes, aligned on an 8-byte boundary,
uninitialized.

=== blob?

<procedure>(blob? X)</procedure>

Returns {{#t}} if {{X}} is a blob object, or
{{#f}} otherwise.

=== blob-size

<procedure>(blob-size BLOB)</procedure>

Returns the number of bytes in {{BLOB}}.

=== blob->string

<procedure>(blob->string BLOB)</procedure>

Returns a string with the contents of {{BLOB}}.

=== string->blob

<procedure>(string->blob STRING)</procedure>

Returns a blob with the contents of {{STRING}}.

=== blob=?

<procedure>(blob=? BLOB1 BLOB2)</procedure>

Returns {{#t}} if the two argument blobs are of the same
size and have the same content.
