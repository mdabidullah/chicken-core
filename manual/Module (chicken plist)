== Module (chicken plist)

As in other Lisp dialects, CHICKEN supports "property lists"
associated with symbols.  Properties are accessible via a key that can
be any kind of value but which will be compared using {{eq?}}.

=== get

<procedure>(get SYMBOL PROPERTY [DEFAULT])</procedure>

Returns the value stored under the key {{PROPERTY}} in the property
list of {{SYMBOL}}. If no such property is stored, returns
{{DEFAULT}}. The {{DEFAULT}} is optional and defaults to {{#f}}.

=== put!

<procedure>(put! SYMBOL PROPERTY VALUE)</procedure>
<procedure>(set! (get SYMBOL PROPERTY) VALUE)</procedure>

Stores {{VALUE}} under the key {{PROPERTY}} in the property list of
{{SYMBOL}} replacing any previously stored value.

=== remprop!

<procedure>(remprop! SYMBOL PROPERTY)</procedure>

Deletes the first property matching the key {{PROPERTY}} in the
property list of {{SYMBOL}}. Returns {{#t}} when a deletion performed,
and {{#f}} otherwise.

=== symbol-plist

<procedure>(symbol-plist SYMBOL)</procedure>
<procedure>(set! (symbol-plist SYMBOL) LST)</procedure>

Returns the property list of {{SYMBOL}} or sets it.  The property list
is a flat list of alternating properties and values.

This list is not guaranteed to be a fresh copy, so avoid mutating it
directly.

=== get-properties

<procedure>(get-properties SYMBOL PROPERTIES)</procedure>

Searches the property list of {{SYMBOL}} for the first property with a
key in the list {{PROPERTIES}}. Returns 3 values: the matching
property key, value, and the tail of property list after the matching
property. When no match found all values are {{#f}}.

This tail of the property list is not guaranteed to be a fresh copy,
so avoid mutating it directly.

{{PROPERTIES}} may also be an atom, in which case it is treated as a
list of one element.
