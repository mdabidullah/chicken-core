README for scripts/
===================


This directory contains a couple of things that might be useful:

  test-dist.sh

    Takes a platform-designator and the path to a tarball and unpacks,
    builds and tests the chicken distribution contained therein.

  makedist.scm

    Creates a distribution tarball from a chicken svn checkout.

  mini-salmonella.scm

    A minimalistic version of `salmonella', the egg-test tool. It
    takes a path to a local checkout of the extensions repository
    and compiles each egg from scratch, reporting success or 
    failure.
